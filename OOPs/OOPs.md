# Object-Oriented Programming
It is a programming paradigm based on objects — data (fields) and behavior (methods) — used to model real-world entities.

## Class
A class is a blueprint that defines the fields (properties) and methods (behavior) for objects.
Example: a Car class defines properties like id, model, color and methods like start(), stop().

## Object
An object is an instance of a class: it holds specific values for the class's fields and can use its methods.
Example: a Car object with id=1, model="Civic", color="Blue".

## Pillars of OOP
- Inheritance: a class can be derived from another class to reuse and extend behavior (e.g., ElectricCar extends Car).
- Polymorphism: the same interface or method call behaves differently depending on the object's type (e.g., start() overridden).
- Abstraction: expose only essential details and hide implementation.
- Encapsulation: bundle data and methods, restrict direct access to internal state via access modifiers (private fields + getters/setters).
